# Welcome to SwiftLeeds 24

The ultimate coding relay hosted during the SwiftLeeds 2024 conference. You have probably landed here because you're an attendee at the conference, welcome 🙏🏼

## Code Relay

As part of the SwiftLeeds 2024 conference theme, we're hosting a fun coding game during the 2 days of the conference, that we're calling Code Relay 🏆!

Inside this repository you will find an Xcode Project, which is a very simple application. If you receive the baton during the conference then move to the next section.

## I have the baton, what now? 👀

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Xcode project
3. Add some code 👩‍💻
4. Push your changes to a branch
5. Raise a Pull Request to main

Your mission is to add _something_ to the application, it might be a very simple Settings screen, or a new feature. that you think would be awesome, anything.

The only thing we ask is make sure it's compiles 😝!

## I have pushed some changes, what now?

Pass the baton to **anyone** in the conference, don't be shy! If they don't want the baton find someone else!

Let's build something great together, who knows we might just be able to ship it 🚢.

## Thanks, but what do I get?

Satisfaction, enjoyment... maybe something else? 🤟🏼!
